  Hey, I’m Sam Dillin. I’m a Software Developer from Harding University. I have a bachelor’s in Computer Science and
  finished with a 2.7 GPA. My education covers an assortment of back-end and front-end development. Most of what I
  learned was theoretical practise with real world examples.

  My first experience with programming started when my brother threw a dead tree book on my desk labeled “Learn to
  Program, Second Edition.” It is a book about Ruby. At that time, I was first learning about computers and how to use
  them. Being younger, I wasn’t a dedicated learner and easily distractible. It was also tedious at the time because I
  didn’t have an IDE. Every program was written in plain text and then ran through linux’s terminal. This small indie
  game, Minecraft, had caught my attention so I focused less on programming. When I was younger, I stopped way too
  early, because I was about to get to the fun stuff about learning functions to reuse code. Hindsight is 20/20 but the
  spark was there.

  During college I was dedicated to make my education successful. It was enjoyable to see the fruits of my efforts as I
  progressed. Every new class added another tool in my toolbelt. My focus was to learn skills that I would be able to
  use myself.

  For my junior year in college, I picked up a part time job working as a cook at my local pizza place. It was difficult
  maintaining a 15hr part time job while being a full time student with 15-16hrs. To me, I think these classes were
  designed to weed people out. However I was able to succeed by maintaining a schedule and sticking to it. The key for
  me was working ahead of time instead of close to the deadline.

  I still have much to learn as I gain more experience. With my current knowledge, I feel like I have a good base to
  start from. My work ethic and experience with others have taught me valuable lessons as well. For any project, I’ll be
  able to get the job done.
